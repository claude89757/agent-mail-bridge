/**
 * Persistence for the `clarification_requests` table (D-P4B4-3 migration
 * 003, D-P4B4-3 API shape) — the persistence half of threat-model control C8
 * (clarification binding: token + thread + candidate-set version + TTL,
 * `docs/threat-model.md`; the deterministic judgement half lives in
 * `src/domain/clarificationState.ts`'s `checkClarificationBinding`).
 *
 * `transition` re-enforces the D-P4B4-1 state machine
 * (`src/domain/clarificationState.ts`) just before persisting a status
 * change, exactly like `commandStore.updateStatus` (D-P2-2),
 * `outboxStore.transition` (D-P2-3) and `intentStore.transition` (D-P3P-4):
 * read current status, assert BEFORE writing, so an illegal transition
 * throws `IllegalTransitionError` and leaves the row untouched.
 *
 * `create` additionally enforces the D-P4B4-1 SUPERSEDED-before-insert
 * invariant, which none of the other three stores need an analogue of: a
 * command may have at most one PENDING clarification at a time. Re-issuing
 * (a fresh candidate set for the same command) transitions every existing
 * PENDING row for that `commandId` to SUPERSEDED (reason `'REISSUED'`)
 * BEFORE the new row is inserted, in ONE transaction — see `create`'s own
 * doc comment for why no explicit rollback code is needed to make that
 * atomic.
 *
 * `candidate_set_json` is opaque TEXT end to end here: this store never
 * parses or validates it — the candidate structure is Phase 4 proper's call
 * (plan's explicit scope cut), and doing anything with the JSON here would
 * assume a shape this batch has no business assuming.
 *
 * Statements are prepared fresh per call rather than cached as fields,
 * matching `commandStore.ts`'s documented rationale: inline preparation
 * keeps each method self-contained and fully inferred, and at
 * one-mail-at-a-time call volume the prepare() cost cannot matter.
